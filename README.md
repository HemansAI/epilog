## Installation

* Make sure you have Docker, Docker compose V2 installed on you system.
* Clone the repo.
* Go to the root directory and run:

    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```
## Exploration

* To access the Kibana dashboard, go to: `https://kibana.localhost`.
* Since our reverse proxy adds SSL to the localhost, your browser will complain about the site being unsafe. Just ignore that and move on.
* Use `elastic` as username and `debian` as password.
